Nokia has already released a [software update for 770](http://europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,,79636,00.html). I just recently updated mine. It was relatively easy. Once you type your 770's MAC address to the form on the software upgrade page you can get to the actual download page. From there you can get an upgrade software that works on Windows  (Check [here](http://maemo.org/maemowiki/HOWTO_FlashLatestNokiaImageWithLinux) if you have Linux of Mac OS). I had some minor problems when I tried to update the device. I was doing this on Windows XP. At the first time I got an error message saying that the update software was not able to write on the USB device. I don't know whether there was something wrong with the Windows XP or what, but on the second time the update went through. It was relatively easy to do and I think anyone who can attach an USB device on their computer will be able to do it. I cannot say much about the improvements in this version yet, but at least it seems like it's a little faster to use.
