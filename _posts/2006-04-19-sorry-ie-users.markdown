I was just browsing through the statistics of my site using [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com) and was pleasantly surprised that 60 per cent of the visitor of my site were using [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/). Of course more users all the time are moving from IE to other browsers, but this number felt like too good to be true. Once I opened my site with IE, I understood the reason.

Recently I moved all the images on my blog to [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) to save bandwidth. Then I also changed the width of the images and for some reason it totally messed up the site for IE. It's no wonder since we all know how well IE handles CSS etc. Well at first I thought that IE users get what they've asked for, but now I've edited the site so that it works also with IE. Sorry IE users... I'll try my best to support you from now on.
