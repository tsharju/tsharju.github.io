I almost missed this one since I was sort of celebrating the new year already when this came out. The new software release for [Nokia 770](http://www.nokia.com/770) was released on 30th of December. You can grab it from [here](http://europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,,79636,00.html). You might want to download the update software also since it has been updated to version 1.5 as well. Again, there is no changelog about what has changed since the last version, but the most important update is actually quite visible. The device works much faster after this update and so far I haven't seen any "out of memory" messages, even when surfing the pages that previously showed that. I use the video player alot and seems like video files also open now much quicker than before. Most likely the memory issues are not gone totally, but there has been improvement in that area. The browser is now much more pleasant to use since pages load faster.

This update gave me confidence considering the major update that is supposed to be realeased soon. If I was eager about that earlier, now I am even more...
