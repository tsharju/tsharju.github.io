So, I got the [N800](http://www.nokiausa.com/N800) yesterday and have been using it for one evening. First of all, I was really impressed on the way that it "feels" when I'm holding it in my hand. It has definitely more "high-tech" feel to it than the [Nokia 770](http://europe.nokia.com/770). Also, the touch screen feels a bit better and the stylus is somewhat thicker which is good in my opinion.

It is definitely somewhat faster than its predecessor. But maybe not as much improvement on that area as I expected. Of course, you see the difference when you e.g., browse to some large websites, but overall the operating system is not that much faster than the old one. Yes, the OS on Nokia 770 improved quite a lot in terms of performance during the one year I used it, so I'm expecting some performance improvements here as well, if possible.

The biggest improvement in terms of browsing is the updated Opera browser with Flash 7 support. Basically, this could mean that definitely the coolest service on the web currently, [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com), should work on this baby. It does, but the frame-rate is definitely too low. It is close to satisfying when the video quality in Flash settings is set to the lowest possible, but still it is not usable in longer term. The area where I'm looking forward for the performance improvements the most is definitely here.

So far, the features that I've enjoyed the most is the new "stand" that is attached to the device now. Even on the sofa, where I probably use this device the most, I don't have to hold it on my hand since the stand is always with me. Also, the possibility to use two memory cards and basically all the variations or SD and MMC is a great addition. I also like that I can use the device now with my native language (Finnish). I was a bit surprised when I installed the [FreeCiv game](http://syslog.movial.fi/archives/30-FreeCiv-port-for-Maemo-2.0-platform.html) and noticed that it is now also in Finnish. But yeah, that's the way it goes when localization is done properly. Yes, and of course I like the improved performance although I'm expecting something more in that area in the future.

I'm quite confident that I haven't figured out all the cool improvements on N800, so I can't give my final judgement yet. But so far I'm very satisfied.
