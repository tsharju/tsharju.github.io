It was announced on [Maemo mailing list](http://maemo.org/pipermail/maemo-announce/2006-April/000025.html) couple of minutes ago that a new Nokia 770 software version is available for download. Get it [here](http://www.maemo.org/downloads/nokia_770?f=Nokia_770_SE2005_5_2006_13_7.bin).

Version number is 5.2006.13-7, but sadly there is no changelog available. It is still the 2005 edition, so don't expect it to do VoIP quite yet.
