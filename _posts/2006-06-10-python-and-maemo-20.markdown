As we all probably know by now the [Beta version of Maemo 2.0 and OS2006](http://maemo.org/downloads/releases.html#maemo20beta) has been released. Too bad that I forgot my Nokia 770 at work and I cannot test the new software yet. :( Of all the weekends, why It had to be now.

Anyway, I've been browsing through the Maemo.org site and I noticed that there was very nice [Python tutorial](http://maemo.org/platform/docs/pymaemo/python_maemo_howto.html) there that includes lots of useful information. It seems that now it is really possible to develop fully working applications for Maemo platform using Python, since LibOSSO and D-BUS services are included. The tutorial has also very good instructions on how to make application installer packages from your Python applications.

The tutorial mentions that the Nokia 770 software images won't include the Python runtime by default, but it has to be installed separately. This is quite understandable considering the amount of memory that is available on Nokia 770 for installable software. Also according to the tutorial the Pymaemo runtime package should be downloadable via maemo.org, but I haven't found it yet. Anyway, the future looks promising.

Please also note that my [previous tutorials](http://www.teemuharju.net/pymaemo-tutorials/) do not apply anymore on Maemo 2.0 since hildon.App and hildon.AppView have changed to hildon.Program and hildon.Window.
