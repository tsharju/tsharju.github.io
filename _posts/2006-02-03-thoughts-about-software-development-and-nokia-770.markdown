This morning I read [a post by michaelalanjones](http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showpost.php?p=8818&postcount=1) from [internettablettalk.com](http://www.internettablettalk.com) and I have to say he has got a point in what he is saying. Some people are complaining about lack of software for Nokia 770 and are almost demanding something to be developed. This is something that causes dislike among open source communities. This is not how it should be.

A device like [Nokia 770](http://www.nokia.com/770) is still, even though it is relatively popular, a sort of a geek gadget. There is no big companies developing software for it, like for example for some Windows based PDAs. The whole approach with this device is different. It is very hard for a totally new device to get software developed for it. But the approach that Nokia has chosen with the Nokia 770 could not be better.

Since it is based on standard Linux operating system, application development for it is very easy. It does not require very much effort to port some existing Linux Gtk application on it, as we have already seen. But as michaelalanjones mentioned, people should remember that free software is usually developed as a hobby. If someone wants some sort of application developed, they should contribute somehow to the community. There are plenty of ways contributing and it always does not even require coding skills. People can help with for example documentation, testing and reporting bugs etc.

One reason why I started to blog about [coding for Nokia 770 with Python](http://www.teemuharju.net/2006/01/26/coding-for-nokia-770-using-python-part-1/) was exactly this. People want some specific applications and with Python it is relatively easy to develop something and it is relatively easy to learn. Still, it requires quite a lot of time and effort to develop actually usefull software so that is something that the people who use the free software should understand. Someone has sacrificed their personal time to develop the software.

Ok, enough preaching for today. Go on people and contribute to the open software community. If you give something, you are more likely also to get something you want.
