Official Python for Maemo 1.1 has been released on [pymaemo.sourceforge.net](http://pymaemo.sf.net). This is first working version with an installer that I have seen. It comes with Python 2.4.2, Numerical Python 23.8, Pygame 1.6, PyGTK 2.6.1 and Python Hildon 0.6.0.

If you have ever felt like you would like to code something for Nokia 770 and felt like learning C-programming sounds too much work, here is your change. Go to [python.org](http://www.python.org) and read the [Python 2.4.2 tutorial](http://www.python.org/doc/2.4.2/tut/tut.html) to learn how to code in Python. Just for practise it might be good idea to install Python runtime for Windows or whatever OS you are using and learn to use the basic Python libraries. There is lots of stuff readily implemented and you really can make cool applications without too much work. For testing graphical user interfaces (Gtk/Hildon) you need to use Nokia 770 or Maemo development environment that is only for Linux. I'll be writing about my experienses of Python with Nokia 770 here on my blog as soon as I have done something worth telling about.
