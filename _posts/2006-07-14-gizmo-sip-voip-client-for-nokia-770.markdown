Yes it has finally arrived. Get the Gizmo Project SIP based VoIP client software for the Nokia Internet Tablet from [here](http://www.gizmoproject.com/nokia770/). Below are some screenshots of it running on my Nokia770. I did brief tests and it seemed to work just fine. Only downside is that it takes 8MBs of memory when installed.
