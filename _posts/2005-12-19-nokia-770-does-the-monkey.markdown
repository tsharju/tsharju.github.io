With the help of [ScummVM](http://www.scummvm.org) of course. You only need to download the [ScummVM for Nokia 770](http://770.fs-security.com/scummvm/) and you are ready to go. Of course, if you have original versions of the games for example for PC. Just copy the [required files](http://www.scummvm.org/documentation.php?view=datafiles) to your N770 and you can play games like Monkey Island 1 & 2, Maniac Mansion, Zak McKracken etc...

So far I've tried only [Monkey Island ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island) and I have to say I'm hooked again. This is the game that I used to play when I was a kid and it still is one of the best games ever made. They really don't make games like this anymore.
