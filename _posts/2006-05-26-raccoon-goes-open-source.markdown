Earlier, I wrote about the [Raccoon web server](http://www.teemuharju.net/2006/05/03/how-about-running-a-web-server-on-your-mobile-phone/) that you can run on your mobile phone. I just found out that [it has been released as open source](http://opensource.nokia.com/projects/mobile-web-server/). Also the gateway implementation has been released, so now you are no more attached only to the project's own gateway. A brief look at the gateway install instructions seemed to be quite complicated, but I'm definitely planning to set up one to my home server.

This is the first, but rather small step towards having your mobile phone part of the Internet. Now all we need are flat fee data connections and I think lots of cool new stuff will appear. If you have a [Series 60 phone](http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,,150,00.html?matrixType=s60), give [Raccoon](http://research.nokia.com/research/projects/mobile-web-server/phone-software.html) a try. You'll be amazed by what you can do with it.
