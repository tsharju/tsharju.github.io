I noticed this morning that [Google Calendar](http://calendar.google.com) is available for public. I've been waiting it since I heard that it was coming, since I would have liked to use it on my [Nokia 770](http://www.nokia.com/770). Unfortunately it does not work yet with Opera browser as you can see from the screenshot below. I need to wait still...
