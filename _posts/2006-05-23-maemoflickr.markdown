Besides working with the [BitTorrent client](http://www.teemuharju.net/2006/05/23/bittorrent-for-maemo-continued/), I've been also working with application that I call MaemoFlickr. I've been building this application from scratch and when it is ready it will be able to upload photos to [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) using simple and intuitive user interface. The intention is that if you have camera phone or something you could easily upload the photos you've taken to Flickr. Future versions might include also some photo organizing features, but I think that for starters it is probably better to keep it simple.

Here are some screenshots...
