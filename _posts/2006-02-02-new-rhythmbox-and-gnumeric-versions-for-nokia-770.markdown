Eduardo de Barros Lima has released a new version of [Gnumeric spreadsheet application](http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/) for Nokia 770. It includes some fixes to previous versions, but still has some minor bugs in it. For more information read [Eduardo's post in his blog](http://etrunko.blogspot.com/2006/01/gnumeric-162-released.html).

New version of Rhythmbox has also been released. Read more about it in [this post](http://tuxrecife.blogspot.com/2006/01/new-year-new-projects-new-files.html). This fixes some issues with DAAP sharing that some people had experienced with the earlier versions.
