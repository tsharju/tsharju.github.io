Since summer holidays are now over (for me at least), it is time to start getting familiar with the new [Pymaemo](http://pymaemo.sf.net) version for [Maemo 2.0 platform](http://www.maemo.org). I decided to start with a no-brainer by porting the [pysqlite](http://www.pysqlite.org) library, since I thought it might be useful in my future projects. I'll put the link to the deb-packages to the [MaemoWiki Application Catalog](http://maemo.org/maemowiki/ApplicationCatalog2006?action=show#head-791d286281c364506920899c1eceb08e888296e1).

I'm also continuing to work with the [BitTorrent](http://www.teemuharju.net/2006/05/23/bittorrent-for-maemo-continued/) and [Flickr Uploader](http://www.teemuharju.net/2006/05/23/maemoflickr/) clients that I wrote about earlier. I'm also very eager in testing the new D-Bus and GStreamer stuff that should also be possible in the new Pymaemo version. Maybe, I even get [my tutorial section](http://www.teemuharju.net/pymaemo-tutorials/) back up againg and updated to Maemo 2.0 stuff. But still [the best Python tutorial so far](http://maemo.org/platform/docs/pymaemo/python_maemo_howto.html) can be found from the Maemo Howto pages.
