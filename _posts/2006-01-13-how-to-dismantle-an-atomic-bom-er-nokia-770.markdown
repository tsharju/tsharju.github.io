Quite interesting (also quite useless) information about how to [dismantle a Nokia 770](http://www.uselessinfo.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/dismantlen770.htm) on [uselessinfo.org.uk](http://uselessinfo.org.uk/). Also nice [exploded view](http://www.uselessinfo.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/explodenokn770.htm) of the device can be found from the same site. Although the instructions are quite detailed, I wouldn't dare to try that on my Nokia 770.

_Edit:

And for the disbelievers. Look the exploded view on the bottom left. Indeed... there is a microphone._
