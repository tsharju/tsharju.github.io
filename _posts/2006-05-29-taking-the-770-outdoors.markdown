Last weekend I was doing some travelling and ended up spending some time in Finnish city called [Lahti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahti). As I was standing at the railway station waiting for my friend to arrive I remembered reading some news that Lahti has built a WLAN network covering most of the city and that this network would be open for everyone. Naturally, I had my [770](http://www.nokia.com/770) with me and I tried to find this open WLAN using that. To my surprise I actually found an open WLAN network and I was able to connect to the Internet using that. It was nice to be able to check my emails and read interesting blog posts while waiting for a train to arrive. Sadly, there are not many open WLAN networks in Finland. In [Helsinki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki) there are only couple.

Btw, the display of the 770 seemed to work quite nicely outdoors. Of course, the sun does not shine much in here in Finland, but I didn't even need to put the display brightness to full.
