[FON](http://www.fon.com) was offering their WLAN access points for free here in Finland, so I went and ordered one. It didn't cost me anything so I had nothing to lose. I have to say that I'm really impressed of the quality that FON has been able to produce with this thing. The access point was packed in a very cool looking package. Also the instructions manual was way better than in any manual of a "commerical product" I've seen. Also, the WLAN AP itself has a cool and kind of Apple look. Look at the image below. Doesn't that D-Link router look damn ungly next to the FON router. I'm running my FON access point in a "Linus" mode, so all other Foneros, you are welcome to use my shared access and you can expect me lurking at your corners as well. ;)
