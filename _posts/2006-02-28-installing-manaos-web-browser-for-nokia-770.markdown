[Antonio Gomes](http://tonikitoo.blogspot.com/) has released a 0.1.1 RC1 of Manaos web browser for Nokia 770. Installing it on the device takes a little hacking, but is doable. You can find installing instructions from [here](http://tonikitoo.blogspot.com/2006/02/getting-manaos-browser-011-rc.html). Version 0.2 should fix the installing problems, but I think I might test the 0.1.1 version just to see how well it works. It would be really nice to have a open source Mozilla based browser for Nokia 770.
