Yesterday I went with my colleagues from work to blow of some steam at a shooting range called [West Shooters](http://www.westshooters.com). The best part was when I got to shoot with a [.44 Magnum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.44_magnum). Yeah the same gun that [Dirty Harry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Harry) has. It was great fun. Anyway, I have to admit that I'm not really a too much of a shooter and pretty much did not hit anything. But I was good enough to hit five shots out of six to the target. A bit high though... I wonder why. ;)

A good way to end a post like this is a quote from Harry Callahan himself:


<blockquote>
"Ah Ah, I know what you're thinking. 'Did he fire six shots or only five?' Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement I've kinda lost track myself. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?"
</blockquote>
