Andrew Flegg has created a perl script that goes through the [maemowiki application catalog](http://maemo.org/maemowiki/ApplicationCatalog) and creates an RSS feed about the new and updated software. This makes it easy to follow what new stuff there is for Nokia 770. Feed is updated at 4am UK time every day. Read more about it on [Andrew's site](http://bleb.org/software/770/#rss). The feed itself can be found from [here](http://www.bleb.org/software/770/apps.rss). I added it to my [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com) account and it works great. I found already couple of new applications that I hadn't noticed earlier.
