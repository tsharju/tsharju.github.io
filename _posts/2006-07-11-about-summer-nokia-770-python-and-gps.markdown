Huh, man it has been a hot summer here in Finland. It has been something like 30 degrees centigrade for a month now and I'm sort of thinking that this starts to be enough. Anyway, I haven't been writing to my blog for quite a while now. I was on a vacation for some time and in couple of weeks I will go out for some more. Meanwhile, a lot has been happening with the Nokia Internet Tablet. The [final version of the 2006 software](http://www.maemo.org/#date_07072006) has been released and now we finally have also a almost fully functional [Python runtime for the Maemo 2.0](http://blog.gustavobarbieri.com.br/2006/06/python-in-maemo-20-repository.html) platform as well. Now it is time to start making some serious Python applications for the Nokia 770.

I bet that everyone that has the Nokia 770 knows about the [Maemo Mapper](http://gnuite.com:8080/nokia770/maemo-mapper/). I've also been using it for some time know and finally yesterday I wen out and bought myself a bluetooth GPS receiver so that I can fully utilize the power of Maemo Mapper. I have to say that I'm impressed. It works like a charm. Btw... the GPS receiver that I have is [Insmat InsSiRF III](http://www.insmat.fi/webcatalogicecom/products.php?q=inssirf&pg=860&lang=en&x=0&y=0).
