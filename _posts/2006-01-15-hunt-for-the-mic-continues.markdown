[JMills posted](http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showpost.php?p=7265&postcount=30) on [Internet Tablet Talk Forums](http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums) that he has been able to "get audio pass-through to work just fine" on [Nokia 770](http://www.nokia.com/770). Interesting news... haven't tried that yet. This sort of confirms that the is a mic _(if it wasn't confirmed yet)_ and proves that it is not locked somehow. I don't know why it would be prevented to use the mic currently, but there are not any applications using it.
