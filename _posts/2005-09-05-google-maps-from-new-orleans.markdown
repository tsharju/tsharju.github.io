As in my previous post I mentioned about photos from New Orleans disaster appearing on Flickr, now also [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com) is showing what has happened there [via satellite images](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=new+orleans&ll=29.950807,-90.081142&spn=0.006014,0.010131&t=k&hl=en). Google Maps has a special Katrina button for New Orleans area. The new satellite images were taken on Wednesday, August 31st.

That superdome isn't looking that super anymore.
