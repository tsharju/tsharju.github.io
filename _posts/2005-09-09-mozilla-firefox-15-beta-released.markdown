Mozilla has released first beta of their new Firefox version 1.5. The final version is scheduled later this year.

Version 1.5 will include features such as:



	
  * improved software update system

	
  * faster back and forward navigation

	
  * a feature for clearing private browsing data

	
  * drag-and-drop reordering of browser tabs

	
  * a redesigned Options/Preferences window

	
  * better popup blocking



Web standards support is also improved, with support for Scalable Vector Graphics, JavaScript 1.6 and more CSS.

Features are looking good. Hopefully this version will make more IE users to swap to Firefox so that web developers can really start taking the advantage of the new web standards.

Firefox 1.5 Beta 1 can be downloaded from [here](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/). And remember that for now it is for testing purposes only.
