This is getting quite old news already, since this has been published on [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/20/1140221&tid=154&tid=95&tid=1) couple of weeks ago, but now that I got my blog running I had to write something about it, I mean about [getoutfoxed.com](http://getoutfoxed.com).

It's a social networking plugin for the popular [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org) browser. This means that you can rate the sites while you browse and then share your list of sites with other outfoxed users. I recommend that you give it a go. It integrates nicely with [Google](http://www.google.com), which makes it really usefull. If you feel like I'm trustworthy person enough you can add me as your outfoxed informer [here](http://getoutfoxed.com/users/Teemu_Harju).
