Last week Nokia released a [music edition of their 6630 model](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000807059448/) and there they mentioned that it will also include new music player software. Since then I've been wondering where I could get that player for my already existing 6630. Now I can stop wondering, since it is downloadable from [here](http://www.fullmaza.com/downloads/download.php?cat=21&pic=2018). I don't know if it was Nokias intention to give out this player, but anyway it has and it seems to be quite good. Let's see how this goes. I think I might need a bigger memory card.
