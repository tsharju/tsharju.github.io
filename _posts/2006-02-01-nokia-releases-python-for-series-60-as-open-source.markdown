Nokia has made the source code for [Python for Series 60](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pys60) available via Sourceforge.net. Let's hope that many developers join the project to develop it further. Python for Series 60 is now in version 1.3.1 and it is quite usefull for fast mobile application development.
