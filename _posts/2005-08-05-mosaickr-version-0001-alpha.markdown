Now I've gotten this far in [my Python for Series 60 project](http://www.teemuharju.net/2005/08/03/something-flickr-on-my-mobile/). The app is called Mosaickr and you can see a pic of it below. At the moment it fetches a random picture from Flickr and then puts the picture into pieces. What I still need to do is to shuffle the pieces and make them move using arrow keys. When I get this ready I will put it on my site for download. Hopefully soon... ;)
