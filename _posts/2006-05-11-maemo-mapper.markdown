[gnuite on Itt forums](http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1947&page=1&pp=10) wrote a post about a new GPS application he has been working on for Nokia 770. It's called [Maemo Mapper](http://gnuite.com:8080/nokia770/maemo-mapper/) and I have to say it is a really nice application to have even though you don't have a GPS receiver. It uses [maps from Google](http://maps.google.com) and works nice and smooth unlike when you use Google maps via the browser. I cannot really comment anything about the GPS features since I don't have one, but this application makes me seriously consider purchasing one.
