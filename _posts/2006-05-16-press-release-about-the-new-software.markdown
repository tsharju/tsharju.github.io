Nokia has released a [press release](http://www.nokia.com/A4136001?newsid=1051308) about the new upcoming software update for [Nokia 770](http://www.nokia.com/770).

It does not mention the release date for the software yet, but says that it will be released during the second quarter of this year. This would mean that it would be released within one month. Lets hope this schedule holds.

Interesting thing about the press release was that it mentions the [Gizmo Project](http://www.gizmoproject.com). So it will have SIP also. Nice... :D

_Edit:

There seems to be also a [webcast of the press conference](http://www.nokia.com/press/770InternetTablet). I just missed the live feed but the site claims that it would be soon viewable on-demand.

_Edit 2:

And this is what it looks like... ;)
