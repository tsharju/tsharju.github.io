[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.xom) is soon getting a [P2P](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_to_peer) filesharing extension called [AllPeers](http://www.allpeers.com). A quote from their site says:



<blockquote>
AllPeers is a free extension which combines the strength of Firefox and the efficiency of BitTorrent to transform your favorite browser into a media sharing powerhouse.
</blockquote>



Seems interesting. I can't wait to test this extension. A beta version should be out pretty soon.
