For some time now I've been waiting for a proper release of [Flite](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/) to show up on Nokia 770 and now it has happened. Flite is a free text-to-speech application that makes your tablet talk the talk. Check [moimart's blog](http://moimart.org/2006/04/19/flite-iii/) to download a test application.

The Flite tablet edition includes also a [D-BUS](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus) service so that it can be used from other applications. Just imagine what cool things you could do with this one. Wouldn't it be nice to get your tablet wake you up in the morning and read the weather forecast or news headlines to you. Now I still need to wait for the D-BUS libraries to come out for [Pymaemo](http://pymaemo.sf.net) and I will make that happen (if someone who knows C-programming has not done it before that).

PS. However I still prefer my girlfriend to wake me up in the morning, but she just won't read the weather forecast or the news headlines for me no matter how nice i ask. ;)
