After learning that there really is a [microphone in Nokia 770](http://maemo.org/pipermail/maemo-developers/2005-June/000315.html) it sort of hit me. Soon I will have a WLAN VoIP phone running on Linux. After the [software update](http://europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,,75023,00.html) coming early next year of course. How will it work as a phone remains to be seen, but I have high expectations.

I have some earlier experience from [Zyxel's Prestige 2000W](http://www.zyxel.com/product/P2000W.php) WLAN VoIP phone and I really can't say anything positive about it. Well the price is half of the N770's, but it sort of includes one per cent of it's features. You can do the math. ;)

Anyhow, I have some suspicions about N770 as a phone. How would I hold it on my hand? Where would I talk to? I'm having sort of scary flashbacks from seeing people talking to an NGage. As Hedgecore said on [Internet Tablet Talk Forums](http://www.internettablettalk.com): I wouldn't like people thinking that I'm "[trying to talk to a calculator](http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3019&postcount=24)". Well it remains to be seen how well it works for mobile use. At least using a bluetooth headset would work perfectly.

I could easily see myself using N770 as a desktop VoIP phone. If the microphone is good enough, it would be a great speakerphone. The VoIP software coming early next year is probably included with instant messaging features also. Then again it would be nice to have presence support as well. After all, N770 is running on Linux so it just needs someone to code it if it isn't included. At least [minisip](http://www.minisip.org) is already [being ported](http://maemo.org/maemowiki/ApplicationCatalogWip#head-81622f0269cdeec218e9e4070b94a1216027bfc1).
