It was announced yesterday on the [maemo developers mailing list](http://maemo.org/pipermail/maemo-developers/2007-January/007218.html) and reported by [some](http://etrunko.blogspot.com/2007/01/python-25-for-maemo-has-been-released.html) [bloggers](http://www.internettablettalk.com/2007/01/16/python-25-for-maemo-released/) already, that new version of Python for Maemo has arrived. Project has recently moved from [Sourceforge](http://pymaemo.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/) to [Maemo Garage](http://pymaemo.garage.maemo.org/) and the version of Python language was updated from 2.4 to 2.5. The new runtime package should work on both the Nokia 770 and the new Nokia N800.

I'm really expecting to start experimenting with this on N800. I already found a neat example on [how to access the webcam using Python](http://www.maemo.org/platform/docs/howtos/howto_camera_api_bora.html#camera_python). I just need to install the new SDK and then I'm ready to go. I also noticed that the new site lists also my year-old tutorials in the [documents section](http://pymaemo.garage.maemo.org/#documentation) so I probably need to start updating them as I learn new things about the new Python for Maemo.

I'm really glad to see also that Python has started to gain interest of  more Maemo developers. [Obscura](https://garage.maemo.org/projects/obscura/) by [Martin Grimme](http://www.advogato.org/person/pycage/) seems really promising. There aren't any releases out there yet, but I think I'm downloading it from the subversion and trying it out. Here is some [more info](http://www.advogato.org/person/pycage/diary.html?start=50) about it if have missed it earlier.
