[Openwengo](http://www.openwengo.com) has released new version of their open source SIP VoIP client. The new version is now more than plain voice, it now includes also support for video. Another bigger improvement in my opinion is that now you can use it with any SIP service. Earlier it was closed to the openwengo network only. I tested the latest [Openwengo Windows version](http://www.openwengo.com/index.php?yawl[S]=wengo.public.download&yawl[K]=wengo.public.download) with my setup of [SER](http://www.iptel.org/ser) and [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org) echo test and it worked perfectly. User interface is still quite heavily customized only for wengo service, but it is still great to see nice looking and functioning open source SIP client. Of course also Linux version exists. Interesting to see how this develops.
