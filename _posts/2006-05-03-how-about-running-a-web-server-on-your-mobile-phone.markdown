Nokia has released [a web server software that you can run on your mobile phone](http://research.nokia.com/research/projects/mobile-web-server/). The software is called Raccoon and it is basically a apache web server for Series 60 phones.

To make you phone truly a member of the Internet, you still need to register it to a server that gives it a URL and makes it possible to make TCP connections from outside to your phone. Sounds complicated and it is, but just blame the mobile operators. Test accounts are limited, but you can apply one and download the software from [here](http://research.nokia.com/research/projects/mobile-web-server/phone-software.html).

Here is a default startup page of my mobsite, running on my Nokia 6630.

You can also do lots of cool stuff with the included concept demos. It is also possible to make your mobsite interactive using Python. How cool is that?
