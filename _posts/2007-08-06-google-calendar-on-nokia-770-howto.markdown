Dan Tye posted a [comment](http://www.teemuharju.net/2006/04/13/google-calendar-is-out-not-for-nokia-770-though/#comments) on my blog describing how it is possible to make your [Google Calendar](http://calendar.google.com) viewable from your [Nokia 770](http://europe.nokia.com/770) or from [Nokia N800](http://europe.nokia.com/n800) using the good old Opera browser. It seemed really useful so I decided to post it here so more people will be able to find it.



<blockquote>
Anyone who has editing control of their own web site can see their Google calendar on the Nokia 770. here is HOW:

1. On your PC, Click the down arrow next to your calendar listing on the left side of your google calendar page and choose CALENDAR SETTINGS from the drop-down.
2. Under “Private Address” in this page, choose the HTML icon.
3. A POP-UP will appear. Click the link to “Configuration Tool”
4. This page will format HTML you can paste into a private address web page you create to display your Google calendar. (choose option 2 under CONTROLS so the Google Icon will not take the top 1/3 of the page.
5. After copying the resulting code to a file or clipboard, simply create your own calendar page on your own web site. Paste the html into the body of the code view of your web page and publish/save it. You may want to set your web site robots.txt file to ignore this calendar page, thus keeping it a bit more private (KGP, not PGP!)

Shortcomings - yes, but better than no access to your Google Calendar!
