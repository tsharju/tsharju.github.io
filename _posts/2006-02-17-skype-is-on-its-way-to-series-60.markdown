Lately my blog has drastically biased towards the Nokia 770 internet tablet, but this is far too interesting news to be left out. [Skype](http://www.skype.com) is coming on the Nokia's Series 60 platform. [Allaboutsymbian.com](http://www.allaboutsymbian.com) reports [experiences of using Skype over 3G network using Nokia 6680 phone](http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/Skype_running_on_Nokia_66880_S60_Handset.php). The report states quite clearly that 3G network might not be suitable for Skype calls and that we might have to wait for some WLAN capable Series 60 phones coming to the markets. Anyhow, very interesting piece of news.
