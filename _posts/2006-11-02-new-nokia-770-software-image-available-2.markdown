It has been quite a while since the last update for the Nokia 770 was released. Well now there is a new release and this time there is a changelog even. For the first time I used the [software update wizard](http://europe.nokia.com/A4144790) and it worked really well. Nice work...

Download the new image from [here](http://www.maemo.org/downloads/nokia_770) if you are a Linux user.
