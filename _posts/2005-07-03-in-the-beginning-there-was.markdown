Huh... finally I got to put up this blog of mine. I tested few free online servises and a few open source blogs and ended up using [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org). It simply had all the features that I needed and it is very easy to install and manage. I recommend.

Anyway... what I'm planning to write in this blog is not quite clear to me yet. At first this will most probably be my on personal diary or something like that but let's see where it goes. I might get some coding projects ready someday and publish some of them here. So we'll see...
