Few days ago I've found a game that really suits for a mobile device. I's called [Alien Pinball](http://www.symbiangear.com/product.html?pid=11308,11311,38435) and like the name states it's a pinball game. Some ten years ago I played alot a game by Digital Illusions called Pinball Illusions and I was really pleased that this game is guite close to that experience. A game is easily played because it only takes two buttons to control the pinball table and that makes the mobile gaming experience very pleasant. I really recommend you all to try this game out. To my opinion, the best mobile game out there. Only complaint is about that there is only one table in this game, but hopefully there will be more soon.
