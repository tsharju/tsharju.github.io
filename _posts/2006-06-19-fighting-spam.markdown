This blog of mine has been drowning in comment spam recently. It is taking me too much time to delete the spam comments so I've decided to include this randomly generated image thing that you need to figure out before you're able to post a comment. I'm sorry for the extra trouble but I think this might be a good way to reduce the spamming. Lets see if it works.
