Tux Paint has been ported for Nokia 770. This is how it is described on their site.



<blockquote>
Tux Paint is a free drawing program designed for young children (kids ages 3 and up). It has a simple, easy-to-use interface, fun sound effects, and an encouraging cartoon mascot who helps guide children as they use the program. (See the [full list of features](http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint/features/).) It provides a blank canvas and a variety of drawing tools to help your child be creative.
</blockquote>



Being a fun program for kids doesn't mean that adults couldn't enjoy it also. To download it go to [maemowiki](http://maemo.org/maemowiki/ApplicationCatalog#head-18ced52a80f7c01149fce1e783e7fe0e6ed39cd6) so you can get also all the dependencies.
