Wohoo... today was my birthday. I'm 26 years old now. Man, I'm feeling like I'm too old already. Anyway... my girlfriend took me to an amusement park to find my inner child again. Look in the picture... I'm the tenth guy from the left on the back row. That thing I'm sitting in is called "Top Spin". If you ever go to Linnanm√§ki in Helsinki I dare you to try it.
