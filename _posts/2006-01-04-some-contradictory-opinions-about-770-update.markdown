In [this post](http://www.teemuharju.net/2006/01/02/new-software-for-nokia-770-out/) I told about the new software that was released for Nokia 770 on 30th of December. After posting that I've seen [lots of posts](http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=901&page=1&pp=10) around the web that this update has messed up peoples devices. Also [Ren√© Seindal](http://linux.seindal.dk/item99.html) reported some issues after update. I haven't had any problems yet.

The update went fine after I had disabled the "RD mode". For some reason I couldn't get the device connect with the update software with RD mode on. After the update everything seems to work better/faster than before. Yesterday I even tried the email client (now I really know why people don't like it) and the RSS reader. RSS reader seemed to work a lot faster, but the UI still makes it unusable. Browsing was really fast and bookmarks open almost instantly. No complaints from me.

Downside for the upgrading is still the fact that making a complete backup of the system is impossible. At least installed applications and browser cookies disappear. Luckily I remembered to manually take backups of my Monkey Island save files. An extra backup of your /home/user directory is worth doing. Some solutions for making post-upgrade hassle little easier can be found from [here](http://linux.seindal.dk/item100.html) and [here](http://www.dillernet.com/apple/2006/01/01/recovering-from-a-firmware-flash/). All in all... these upgrades are making the device much more pleasant to use. Just keep em coming.
