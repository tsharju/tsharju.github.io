Finnish magazine [Taloussanomat is reporting (in Finnish)](http://www.taloussanomat.fi/page.php?page_id=95&news_id=2007442) that Nokia is working together with [Skype](http://www.skype.com) to get Skype for [Nokia's new N800 Internet Tablet](http://www.nokiausa.com/N800/). I also found [an official press release on this](http://www.nokia.com/A4136001?newsid=1096860) and seems like Skype will come by the end of first half 2007 for the N800.
