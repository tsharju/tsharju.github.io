Today Nokia opened site called [opensource.nokia.com](http://opensource.nokia.com). There isn't much new on the site, since most of the stuff that is actually open source on that site has been that for some time already. Like for example Nokia's [Sofia SIP stack](http://sofia-sip.sourceforge.net) has been available already from [sourceforge.net](http://www.sourceforge.net).

On the [projects page](http://opensource.nokia.com/projects/index.html), you can see the list of "open source" projects by Nokia. I wrote the open source in quotes since not all projects on the site are yet open source. Anyhow it's really nice to see stuff like [Python for Series 60](http://opensource.nokia.com/projects/pythonforseries60/index.html) there so probably it will be soon open source as well.

Another interesting project is [Series 60 OSS Browser](http://opensource.nokia.com/projects/S60browser/index.html). It's still under development, but let's hope we'll get a decent browser for series 60 some day. Ok, ok.... [Opera](http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/) is quite good as well, but getting an open source browser for my phone would be too good to be true. ;)
