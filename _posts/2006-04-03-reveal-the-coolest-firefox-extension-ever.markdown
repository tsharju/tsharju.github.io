I just noticed that the [Extend Firefox Contest](http://developer.mozilla.org/contests/extendfirefox/) has ended and the results have been released. Forgive me if this is old news, but I just found about it. Well, that itself is not the reason for this post. The winner extension of this contest was [Reveal](https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=1942&application=firefox) and oh boy... it is really nice. What it does is that it shows the thumbnails of the pages in your session history and tabs and allows you to easily switch between them. In addition to this it also includes a really easy to use magnifying glass.

The thumbnail thing is something that I've always wanted to see on [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com). A similar thing exists on the [new Series 60 open source web browser](http://www.s60.com/browser/) for mobile phones. Here is a screenshot of the Reveal extension, but screenshots don't do justice for an extension like this. You need to try it...
