I just got invited to [Pownce](http://www.pownce.com). Thanks to [salvatore](http://www.pownce.com/samiam010203/) for that. It's like [Twitter](http://twitter.com) but way better. It allows users to do micro-blogging, and share links and files between each other. You can follow my public profile [here](http://www.pownce.com/teemu/public). I just wish I could use Pownce also from my Nokia N800 or from my mobile phone. It would be more real-time that way since I'm carrying those with me pretty much all the time. Well, maybe they'll open an API soon so I could write some client for that purpose then. Btw, I've got couple of invites left to share if someone is interested.
