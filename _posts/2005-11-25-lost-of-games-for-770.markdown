I know that [Nokia 770](http://www.nokia.com/770) is no [PSP](http://www.psp.com) (and the other way around), but Marcelo Oliveira has done great job releasing [a number of games](http://www.marceloeduardo.com/blog/archives/maemo-games-new-packages) for Nokia 770. These include Doom (with multiplayer), MaemoBlocks, MaemoSwap etc... It's a shame that I left my 770 home today so I won't be able to test those yet. Well, maybe it's better that I get even some work done. ;) You can count on me to write some reviews about those games during the weekend.
