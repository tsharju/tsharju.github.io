Today is 23th of December and the last day at work before my tiny three day long Christmas holiday. Feels nice since it is sort of the only holiday I'll have this winter. Today I'm heading up north to meet my big sister and her family and I'll spend my Christmas over there. She doesn't have an Internet connection, which is nice because it sort of forces me to stay away from computers and stuff. Well I'll have my [Nokia 770](http://www.nokia.com/770) with me, but that is only for emergencies. ;)

Anyhow, nice Christmas to everyone and see you again next week.

PS. Here is a sort of Christmas picture of my two dogs, Niilo and Oiva. People who know Finnish can also check [their blog](http://www.niilobichon.net).
