Ok... since [the last time](http://www.teemuharju.net/2005/12/11/stream-your-mp3-files-with-nokia-770/), I've done more testing on how I can stream my MP3 collection at home using [Nokia 770](http://www.nokia.com/770). So far I have found two additional methods. A good and easy way is to use [iTunes](http://www.itunes.com) and [Rhythmbox port for Nokia 770](http://tuxrecife.blogspot.com/2005/12/end-of-year.html) to stream the MP3 collection that you have in your iTunes library. This is easy to do and doesn't require anything but installing iTunes on your PC and Rhythmbox on your Nokia 770. Then just enable music sharing from iTunes properties and launch Rhythmbox with [some special tricks](http://www.teemuharju.net/2005/12/20/rhythmbox-ported-for-nokia-770/#comment-75). Then you are ready to go.

However, I prefer still one other way. That is to install [Ampache](http://www.ampache.org) to your server machine and use the Opera web browser on Nokia 770 to browse your MP3 collection. Ampache creates playlists for streaming the music with the audio player that comes with Nokia 770. Just click on the links and listen. Great about this is that you can also allow your friends to listen your MP3 collection and you don't need to have iTunes running all the time. Well you need the web server, but if you already have that I recommend ampache.
