I stumbled across interesting news about VoIP and Nokia 770 while browsing the web. I found a picture of Larry Page from Google presenting that Nokia 770 will support [GTalk](http://talk.google.com). [The site](http://ces.vnunet.fr/2006/01/prsentation_de__2.html) was in Spanish so I had to rely on [Babelfish](http://babelfish.altavista.com/) to translate it for me, so the news might not be that accurate. I started to think a bit more about this and remembered Google also announcing that [GTalk will be open towards other XMPP services](http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2006/01/xmpp-federation.html#links). Probably it was this that Mr. Page was talking about. So conclusions from this is that Nokia 770 VoIP software will support also [XMPP](http://www.xmpp.org/). This naturally means only instant messaging with GTalk users and that should be already possible using [Gaim for Maemo](https://developer.berlios.de/projects/maemo-gaim/). Or maybe Nokia 770 will also support [Jingle](http://code.google.com/apis/talk/index.html) which has also become freely available. This way it could support also voice. The Jingle option sounds a bit too far fetched, since why would it be needed if Nokia 770 already supports SIP for VoIP. Well, it remains to be seen.

Some thoughts around the web have also risen up from the fact that [Skype](http://www.skype.com) is also available for Ubuntu and Debian linux, so why wouldn't it be also for Nokia 770. Why not? Or more like, why it should? Ok, first of all Skype port would have to be done by Skype and that is very unlikely to happen for a while anyway. Also SIP is the way to go since that is the way to make different VoIP communities interoperable. Users should be able to decide what client software they can use for their VoIP calls and not to be limited only to some special software. I know that Skype works very well and current SIP clients are quite far from that, but we are getting there... some day. Anyway, my opinion is that keep the Skype out of Nokia 770. ;)
