As I already mentioned in my [previous post](http://www.teemuharju.net/2006/07/11/about-summer-nokia-770-python-and-gps/), I bought myself a bluetooth GPS receiver so I can use it with the [Maemo Mapper](http://gnuite.com:8080/nokia770/maemo-mapper/) application. Ok, I had to take this a bit further and since I've seen [other people](http://thoughtfix.blogspot.com/2006/02/howto-bluetooth-gps-and-gpsdrive-on.html) having their Internet Tablet attached to their car's windshields I decided to give it a try. I Googled for a while to find a suitable holder to get the N770 attached to my car. Finally, I found a [Universal PDA Holder](http://www.pdahut.com/store/product.php?productid=17141&cat=0&page=1) sold by the [PDA Hut](http://www.pdahut.com/store/home.php) in UK that seemed to be well suited for this task. Here is a couple of pictures of it in action...

I only made a brief test drive and the holder performed very well. It is easy to adjust it in a right position and it stuck really firmly to the windshield and also to the N770. It is also really easy and fast to attach and remove the Internet Tablet form the holder. I could also connect the Tablet to my car's cigarette lighter to get it charged since most of the connectors are free even when the Tablet is in the holder.

Here's a picture of the whole setup that I have and also couple of closeups of the Universal PDA holder holding the N770.
