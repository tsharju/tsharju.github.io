Have you seen this site yet? [www.clustrmaps.com](http://www.clustrmaps.com) Thanks to Timo for the hint. It's a site that maps the visitors of your site and you can see where they come from. Just look at the example on the right. Clustrmaps is still in beta and you need invitations to join. Big thanks to [Derek](http://www.earthwidemoth.com/mt/archives/000948.html) for giving me one. Now I've got one invitation still left to give... so if you need one let me know.
