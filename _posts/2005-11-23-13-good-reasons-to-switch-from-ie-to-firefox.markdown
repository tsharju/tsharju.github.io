Ok... since there isn't too much time left before [Firefox 1.5](http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=7704) will be released, I thought it might be nice to go through some good reasons to switch from Internet Explorer to Firefox. [www.killbillsbrowser.com](http://www.killbillsbrowser.com) provides just that. The reasons listed there shouldn't bee taken too seriously, but there is a point there. ;)

For website/blog owners in US I'd like to note that there is a real reason to start converting people using Firefox since using [Google Adsense](http://www.google.com/adsense) it is possible to [earn a dollar](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/node/19678) each time someone installs a Firefox through your site. Unfortunately for now this only works for US residents. For others I recommend registering on [spreadfirefox.com](http://www.spreadfirefox.com).
