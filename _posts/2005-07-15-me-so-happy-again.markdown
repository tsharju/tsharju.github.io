Today I got my computer back from the maintenance. :) I was quite surprised that it took only few days from them to fix it. Anyway it's summer time so I bet they aren't too busy at the moment. I haven't tested my computer yet, but I might have to take back some comments I said in my [earlier post](http://www.teemuharju.net/?p=12) about Fujitsu-Siemens laptops. This time they changed the entire motherboard so maybe it was the source of all my troubles. Let's hope so... the guarantee is still only valid for few months on. I'll keep my fingers crossed.
