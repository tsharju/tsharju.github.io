I browsed through [Maemo Wiki](http://wiki.maemo.org) and found some new status bar applications. A [clock applet](http://maemo.org/maemowiki/ApplicationCatalog?action=diff#head-e5fa9375efbb7f584112fef33edc2cf37938d260), that shows analog or digital clock in the status bar and a [statusbar network monitor](http://maemo.org/maemowiki/ApplicationCatalog?action=diff#head-b6ff12fa60304d23da9cd2871cf080317fc4da3c) that shows info about your network connection on the status bar as well.

After having the [CPU/Mem/Screenshot applet](http://maemo.org/maemowiki/ApplicationCatalog?action=diff#head-2a148fa70a8fd181ef6b85fb568785cd31a45e02) also in the status bar, it is getting a bit crowded up there. :)
