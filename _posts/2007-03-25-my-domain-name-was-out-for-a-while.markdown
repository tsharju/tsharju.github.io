My domain name was not re-registered after the one year billing period and the site was not reachable for a while due to that. I guess that my e-mail bil had gotten lost somewhere along the way to my mailbox. Luckily the service provider re-registered my name quicky and now I'm again safe for a year. I might consider switching to paper bil that will be delivered with the good old snail-mail to my front door. It feels safer that way.
