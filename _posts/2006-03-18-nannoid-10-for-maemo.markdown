In my [previous post](http://www.teemuharju.net/2006/03/15/experimenting-with-pygame-on-nokia-770/) to this blog I was experimenting with [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org) and found out that a game called [Nannoid](http://www.imitationpickles.org/nannoid/) worked almost fully on the Nokia 770 without modifications. Well, I decided to modify it a bit and now it should be fully playable.

It requires you to have [Pymaemo runtime](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pymaemo/pymaemo-runtime_1.1-1_arm.deb?download) installed. Also, since [Python for Maemo](http://pymaemo.sf.net) does not yet fully support LibOsso (or something?) you wont be able to switch back to another application during the game and you don't see the "loading..." sign when launching the application from the menu. After clicking the menu item, just wait a couple of seconds and the game will launch. You can play the game using the stylus or the keys.

Download the installer package from [here](http://www.saunalahti.fi/~tsharju/pymaemo/nannoid-1.0_maemo.deb). I hope you enjoy the game. Here are some screenshots...
