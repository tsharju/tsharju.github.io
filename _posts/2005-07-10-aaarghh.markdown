My laptop broke down yesterday morning. I am so dissapointed to it. When I bought it about two years ago during Christmas it had two year onsite guarantee. That is good since this was already the second time it broke down. First time was in the beginning of this year when the display of the machine failed. Now it doesn't even start, just flashes the lights for a short period of time and then nothing happens.

And that's even not all. The battery on the laptop lasted for a less than a year and I didn't even use it that much on a battery. When I asked about it from the support they said that it's pretty normal for the batteries to last about a year. Well I understand if the capasity of the battery decreases during that time but in less than a year the battery didn't work even for a second.

So what is this great laptop. It is Fujitsu-Siemens Amilo 8830D. I have to say that I am very dissapointed... I will never buy anything from Fujitsu-Siemens again. My next laptop will for sure be from Apple.
