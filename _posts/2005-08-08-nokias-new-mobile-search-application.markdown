Nokia has released a search application for 6630, 6680 and 6681 phones. It will be bundled with these models, but you can also download it from [here](http://www.nokia.com/mobilesearch/). Seems to work quite well. It uses [Yahoo Search](http://search.yahoo.com/) for searching websites and images. It has also some preconfigured local search services to search for local companies and services. The user interface was far better than in the search engines used through a mobile browser so this might actually be even an application that I might consider using.
