I though that I set up a collection of the [pymaemo](http://pymaemo.sf.net) tutorials I've written so that they would be more easily accessible. From now on you can find them at [pymaemo.teemuharju.net](http://pymaemo.teemuharju.net). Of course, I still put them on my blog also. I haven't written much new tutorials lately, but I think that during the weekend I could write about things like how to create a Hildonized toolbar etc.
