Huh, I was really amazed this morning when I just randomly tried [this link](http://direct.nokia.com/Product.aspx?model=n800) and it worked. The link is or course the page at Nokia Online store that allows one to order the N800 (the improved Nokia 770). The price for Finland was €399. So not too much in my opinion. I was even so eager that I had to pay €32 extra to get it delivered by tomorrow. If you can wait 3-4 days the delivery is free of charge. Lets see if I get it tomorrow. I'll keep writing progess here in my blog.
