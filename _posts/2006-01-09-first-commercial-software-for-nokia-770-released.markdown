New year has started fairly well for [Nokia 770](http://www.nokia.com/770). It has been reported that it's [production has been increased](http://nokia770.com/287) because of the huge demand especially in the USA.

This morning I found also more interesting news from [Nokia 770 blog](http://www.nokia770.com).  An application called [DejaDesktop](http://www.dejadesktop.com/) has been released for Nokia 770. It is free personal information manager (PIM) application that can synchronize itself to Outlook calendar and contacts.  The PIM software is offered for free of charge. The ip-based synchronization service costs then $9.95 per month. You can try it free for two weeks.

Quite interesting that already at this early stage there are some sort of business being done relying on Nokia 770. And the approach is interesting also. Free software, but you have to pay for the service. That is very much the way to go with a device like Nokia 770. Lets hope that we see more of this in the future.
