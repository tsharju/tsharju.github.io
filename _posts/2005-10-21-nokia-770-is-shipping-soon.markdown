At least that is what they say on their [site](http://direct.nokia.com/Product.aspx?model=770#). For those who don't know [Nokia 770](http://europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,1522,,00.html?orig=/770) is a Internet tablet that runs on Linux. It has WLAN connectivity, so you are able to browse the web and listen to Internet radio. So far you are not able to use it for VoIP to make calls over Internet, but that will happen in the beginning of the next year.



<blockquote>The Nokia 770 Internet Tablet's software is upgradeable and currently runs on the Linux-based Internet Tablet 2005 software edition. There is a planned launch next year of an operating system upgrade – the Internet Tablet 2006 software edition – that will support additional services, including Internet telephony (VoIP) and Instant Messaging.</blockquote>



The price in Finland for this beauty is €369,00, which I think is a bit too high. Anyway... looks like I really have to start saving money for this one. _Me wants it... _ :)
