Now I finally got it. I have to say that I'm really impressed how easy it is to use. The start-up wizard did pretty much everything I needed and I got Internet connection up right away. It's a shame that I can't use the WLAN at the office because of the VPN, but with 3G it worked also nicely.

Here is a photo of it on my desk. Sorry about the quality, but my hands were sort of shaking because of the excitement.
