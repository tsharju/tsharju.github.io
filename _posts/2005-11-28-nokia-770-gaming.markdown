As I earlier promised, I tested out the games for [Nokia 770](http://www.nokia.com/770) ported by [Marcelo Oliveira](http://www.marceloeduardo.com/blog/). Here are screenshots from each game (actually they are photos taken with my digicam, since I couldn't figure out how to take screenshots ingame). I also wrote some comments about the games that I have had time to actually test. I have to say that I'm quite impressed about the gaming capabilities of Nokia 770. These games are good for killing time on a bus or something... and I believe this is only a start. :) Click below the picture to read more...

**Doom**

Ok.. this game needs no introductions. The famous game from [iD Software](http://www.idsoftware.com/). You guessed right, it's Doom and it's here on Nokia 770. It runs perfectly as you probably seen already on [video clips](http://www.internettablettalk.com/content/view/79/2/) on the net. It's fairly natural to play with the stylus once you get used to it. Best part of this is that it supports also multiplayer mode. Haven't tested that yet... there aren't too many people with 770 around yet. Anyhow... by far the best game on 770 currently.

**Battlegweled**

This is a nice puzzle game based on Bejeweled that also supports multiplayer. You can play it alone too. Good fun...

**Maemoblocks**

A tetris clone. Really nice looking. Display is turned on the longer side which gives more space for a game like this. I like it...

**Maemodrac**

Simple solitaire game based on [Drac](http://drac-cardlib.sourceforge.net/). This is really nice to play with the stylus. This is usually the game to kill time when sitting in front of your computer. Now you can kill time anywhere. :D

**Maemosweeper**

Minesweeper port for Maemo. Same applies for this as for the previous game...

**Tux Pux**

Tux Pux port for 770. This was kinda difficult to play. Or maybe I just don't know how..

**Crazy Parking**

Haven't played this one too much yet.

Another game that I haven't had time to test yet.
