Today I noticed that [minisip](http://www.minisip.org) has been packed for Nokia 770. The link can be found from [maemo.org Wiki](http://maemo.org/maemowiki/ApplicationCatalogWip#head-81622f0269cdeec218e9e4070b94a1216027bfc1). Installer and the application are still heavily work in progress, but I was already able to register to my SIP service using minisip from Nokia 770. Also I was able to receive call from my [Gizmo](http://www.gizmoproject.com/) account. Well, to be honest I was able to receive the call, but no audio went either way. SIP signaling worked perfectly though, since when I ended the call from my 770, the Gizmo client noticed it as well.

According to  [Marcelo Oliveira](http://www.marceloeduardo.com/blog/archives/tapioca-voip-is-out-check-it-out) Another VoIP project for Nokia 770 called [Tapioca](http://tapioca-voip.sourceforge.net/) will be releasing their SIP VoIP client for Nokia 770 soon. It is only lacking the UI. Hopefully test version will be out soon. We are living interesting times my friends. Soon I will be able to make VoIP calls using my Nokia 770.
