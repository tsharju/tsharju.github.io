I have made this Wordpress plugin that loads your photos from Flickr and makes an album of them on your blog. Read more about it [here](http://flickralbum.teemuharju.net). You can also see it in action in [my photos section](http://photos.teemuharju.net). At the moment it's little limited in features, but I'll keep on developing it. I will try to consentrate on easy installation and usage.

If you have problems intalling or using this, you can post comments in this blog entry. Also give your opinions on how good or bad it actually is and if someone is even using it, let me know.
