Finally it happened. It was announced today in the [Forum Nokia Python section](http://discussion.forum.nokia.com/forum/showthread.php?t=111485) that a 1.4.0 final version of Python for Series 60 has been released. This is something that I've been waiting this for a long time since I've been kind of pissed of with the Symbian signing policy. And guess what... this final version of PyS60 has been officially signed by Nokia with all developer certificate capabilities so no more signing is required for Python application in order to access e.g., the GSM location or GPS APIs. How cool is this? Finally, it is humanly possible to develop applications for S60 mobiles. You can expect to see more PyS60 related stuff in this blog once the summer holidays are over. Until then, have a good summer.... I know I will. :D
