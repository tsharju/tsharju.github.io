[Google Adsense](http://adsense.google.com) has made Firefox referrals now available also internationally. Ok, so what does this mean? It means that you can put an adsense referral link to your webpage and you get a one dollar each time some windows user downloads Firefox browser via that link. You need Google adsense account for that of course. If you want to promote Firefox more efficiently, you should check [www.explorerdestroyer.com](http://www.explorerdestroyer.com). Ok... now everyone, please download the Firefox via my site. Link is there on the right sidebar... ;)
