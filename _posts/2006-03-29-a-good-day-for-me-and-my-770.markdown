Today I participated in a day long seminar and I knew that the location would not have a open WLAN access so I didn't even bother to bring my laptop with me. For the first time I decided to take my 770 with me, since I could check my RSS feeds and read my personal email with it using 3G. I thought that it would be better than nothing. It turned out to be a lot more.

While others were struggling with their Windows XPs and bluetooth modem connections, I already had checked my emails and was reading through today's new blog posts via [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com). 3G connectivity with the 770 hasn't failed me once and the device is instantly ready to be used. I like it... I like it alot. ;)

I had also read about the application called [Xournal](http://xournal.sf.net) and decided to give it a try. It is still rather slow, but somewhat usable for taking quick notes. I can't wait for it to develop a bit further. This is definitely the kind of application that Nokia should have included in 770, not just the stupid and useless sketch and notes utilities.

So far I've just been hacking around with 770 at home or office, but this experience encouraged me to carry it along with me all the time. The day got a really nice ending when I was travelling home from the seminar and was able to write some emails in the train. And the battery lasted all day long. Well, battery indicator had one bar left when I arrived home... but hey, that was enough. ;)
