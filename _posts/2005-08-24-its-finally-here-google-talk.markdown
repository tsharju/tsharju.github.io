Seems like my blog is going to be Google this and Google that, but this is so big that it cannot be left out. Google has released their long waited [Google Talk](http://talk.google.com). It's still in beta (as seems to be everything nowadays), but it should at least support instant messaging and voice calls. I will test this for sure today and probably post some comments here. Like suspected they are using Jabber protocol and here is what Google has to say about open standards.





<blockquote>
We believe that you should have a choice in how you communicate with your friends, that you shouldn't have to use one service because that's where you keep your contacts and other information. We launched free auto-forwarding and POP access for Gmail so our users could take their messages with them and use any service they want, and we're committed to upholding this idea of user choice for Google Talk as well. Today, with instant communications, you can't talk to your contacts or buddies in one service while using another service. We hope to change that. We want to work with other willing service providers to enable their users to communicate directly with Google Talk users. And while we hope many people will use and like the Google Talk client, we're committed to making it as easy as possible for you to communicate with your friends using the client that you want--even if it doesn't happen to be ours. That's why we're also supporting open standards and the same protocol that clients such as Trillian, GAIM and iChat do. For more details, please visit our [FAQ for developers](http://www.google.com/talk/developer.html).
