Have you ever even tought of having a mobile VoIP PBX? No? Well me neither, before I saw [this post on maemo developers mailing list](http://maemo.org/pipermail/maemo-developers/2005-November/002002.html) saying that [Asterisk 1.2.0](http://www.asterisk.org) actually runs on [Nokia 770](http://www.nokia.com/770). Now that it seems to be possible, we just need to figure out what could it be used for. Ideas, anyone?

Whether you can use it for something actually usefull is irrelevant. The point of the whole thing is to show off your geek friends that you have asterisk running in your pocket. :) Anyhow the power of this kind of mobile linux device is that it can really open new ways of doing things that no one has ever even thought of, or even would have thought until they really get to use something like this.
